# Variable Selection for Econometric Analysis

Here I present the first output of literature research for finding food sovereignty indicators from Türkiye focused regional research.

## 1. Intro
### 1.1. Which and How Many Articles are read?
The first batch of research articles are chosen from Dergipark with keywords "kırsal" and "tarımsal" and four extra articles. Among the recipients??, 38 articles are read for variable exploration. In the end, 32 articles contribute to the variable model. Additionally, regarding food security and composite index modeling, 8 articles are present in the first batch. However, they have been left out for focusing on the ground-based model with domestic expert opinion.

### 1.2. The method for finding variables
Firstly, I established the general framework for variable research. My approach includes all "variable" concepts that have a form of social measurability, such as historical change and statistical evidence from regional observation. By focusing on regional observation, I aim to capture what is out of the scope of global research. The regional approach exists at the core of the Food Sovereignty theory. An aggregated understanding of food security misses the particularity of the native living conditions and socio-economic structure. More of the discussion between global-local differences can be found in the literature review.

## 2. Exploration

### 2.1. How many variables are in here?
To define the variable labels, I reprojected the annotation labels specified in the literature research. I used the primary content of the mentioned variables, such that an agricultural economic policy is included in _Governance_ while the secondary content may refer to agroecology, economy, or food networks. Out of 45 annotation labels, 27 variable labels are created. From the first batch of reading, I annotated 251 pieces of text as variables. After the cleaning and merging process, I defined 183 variables to be considered for food sovereignty in the agricultural domain. There are three variables for husbandry that can be included to enhance the framework.


### 2.2. How many categories are in the broader context?
The resulting 183 variables from 27 different labels reveal a degree of overlap between them. Consequently, the final analysis will be in nine categories. Those are land use, policies, rural development, rural life, agricultural diversity, agricultural ownership, agricultural development, economic conditions, and ecological conditions. Here is a very short summary of category definitions:

- Land use: Land size, land fragmentation, land types
- Policies: Financial support, social security, rural administration status
- Rural development: Social facilities (school, health center, consultancy, infrastructure)
- Rural life: Household structure, non-agricultural employment, migration, ethnic structure, gender equality
- Agricultural diversity: Food and industrial agriculture, import-export balances, plant species
- Agricultural ownership: Land ownership and farm scale, ratio of local/foreign inputs
- Agricultural development: Cooperativization, mechanization, capitalization, networks
- Economic conditions: Market values, costs, credits, interest and exchange rates
- Ecological conditions: Climate conditions (humidity, water source, soil), land structure, vegetation


## 3. Selection
### 3.1. What are the indicators of food security?
The original approach to food security claimed by FAO consists of four dimensions which are availability, access, utilization, and stability (Manikas et al., 2023). In the Global Food Security Index (Economist Impact, 2022) there are four categories in parallel which are affordability, availability, quality and safety, sustainability, and adaptation. In the latest report of _Tracking progress on food and agriculture-related SDG indicators_, FAO (2023) utilizes 31 indicators in 8 SDGs. In GFSI (Economist Impact, 2022) there are 68 indicators in 25 subcategories of the 4 four main categories mentioned above.

While the Food Sovereignty framework is not completely out of the picture, its indicators are generally been replaced with consumption proxies and their relative weights are very low in the composite indicator methodology. The fact that food security encompasses the social life environment, and the food sovereignty framework proposes that these indicators need to be prioritized rather than included as sub-indicators. For this reason, assessing the social resilience aspect of food security requires a deliberate weighting methodology focusing on the social reproduction aspect of agricultural life.

### 3.2. What is the food sovereignty framework for variable selection?
Food sovereignty considers food security as a part of resilient conditions in food systems. From production to the consumable end product, the food transforms from seed to nutrition. Human intervention occurs at each stage in the production cycle of the food. Focusing only on food consumption, such as being healthy, accessible, sustainable, and available, does not explain the food producers' resilience in the process. First iterated by La Via Campesina (The Peasant's Way), food sovereignty incorporates the right to food as a right to protect accessibility to food production by local villagers and indigenous communities. 

Social sovereignty of food security thus indicates the right to seed access, land access, facility access, network access, policy access, and information access.

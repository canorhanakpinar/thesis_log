!not finalized! countdown ~ 12 months left

_Currently finishing my NLP training, and finalizing a literature research on (welfare) policies regarding food security in Turkey._


All the work steps for my thesis at Koç University Computational Social Sciences MA program.
I am graduated from Galatasaray University Sociology BA program. https://www.academia.edu/105451701/Analyse_Des_Facteurs_Sociaux_Influençant_La_Qualité_Du_Sommeil

I am creating this repository for Open Science purposes.
I have recently submitted a 25 page proposal as my final paper for Introduction to CSS course.

It's a very amataeur experiment, by the way, and I have !not finalized! my plan.

**Early Description:**

I will consider ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence, justice and assess risks and opportunities, after each minor step data acquisition.

?The effects of Law 6360 on agricultural production and rural life in affected and not affected cities of Turkey, in terms of food sovereignty and security.?
Machine learning; image recognition, natural language processing, regression(PSM and DID), topic classification, raster analysis (, and hopefully a field trip) are initialy chosen methods.
Satellite imagery, parcel transfers, official gazette database, economic, demographic, ethnic, and geographic data shall help me along this way to open my sight for les vérites du monde. 
I will use Python and QGIS software tools.

That's many many methods and data right here. That's a lot of work. That means I have to assess feasibility of everything. Therefore I will create a cost estimation of time and money.

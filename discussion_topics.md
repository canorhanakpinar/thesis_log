# Discussion 

To present the results, I will first structure the discussion section based on expected research outcomes. Firstly I structure the qualitative aspect of the research, then I will design research questions with binary outcomes for empirical consideration. 

### Qualitative Theory Discussion
In three parts, I will discuss the food and agriculture in social systems, the data process model, and the analysis boundaries. 

Food in social systems will be a theoretical part which is explained by academic papers, institutional papers, legal papers, economic volume, and selected anecdotal comments of shareholders. 

Data process model regards acquisition, cleaning & wrangling, econometric transformation, and Python implementation. 

Analysis boundaries are directed answers by my initial hypotheses. I expect to derive suggestions for further research by trying to elucidate unanswered questions and research limitations.

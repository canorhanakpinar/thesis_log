# Literature Research Container

For recording the process, I thought that it would be useful to upload the literature selection here as well.

## The process: 
Download keyword results, and then select what is related to the broader concept of social food security/food sovereignty, rural, and agricultural issues.

Second, I will classify further by topic specialization. Then select the articles related to land use and agricultural policy issues.

Later, I will focus on Turkey's research issues for connecting with the global. 

As this is my very first exploratory research on the food security and sovereignty topic, I am taking notes at random inside the docs.

Finally, I hope to derive a puzzle from these articles.


### Documents
1. In the first part, I started with global research. The file is "food_sovereignty_scopus_13Jun2024.xlsx" containing 1502 abstracts. Tagged 1170 articles, read in chronological order
